Description: SPOA is a C++ library for fast alignment and consensus generation
    of closely related sequences. It allows local, global, and semi-global
    (overlap) alignment, using linear, affine, or convex gap penalties, and can
    also weight by quality scores. SPOAR is an R wrapper for SPOA.
